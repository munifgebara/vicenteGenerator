# Project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Development server

Run \`ng serve\` for a dev server. Navigate to \`http://localhost:4200/\`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run \`ng generate component component-name\` to generate a new component. You can also use \`ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module\`.

## Build

Run \`ng build\` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the \`dist/\` directory. Use the \`--prod\` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run \`ng test\` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run \`ng e2e\` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use \`ng help\` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
